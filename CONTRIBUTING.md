## Issues

Please use the github issue tracker for any bugs or feature requests,
email sent to the maintainer(s) will probably be ignored.
If you would like to backport a feature from `main` to a release
branch, also put a ticket for enhancement.

If you would like to contribute bug fixes or new components,
make sure there is an existing issue for it, and make a pull
request referencing the issue.

We use [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) to write commit messages.
If your changes cause problems with how the library was used before,
don't forget to write `BREAKING CHANGE:` inside the commit message body,
followed by a description of what has changed and how to adapt for it.

## Pull requests

Please use a fork to create pull requests,
instead of branches on this repository.
You can request review of specific users.

Please keep your comments on PRs purely technical, so don't discuss
anything not related to the actual code/changes in the PR.
If you do, your comment might get hidden, with a reason stating
why it was hidden, e.g. "please stick to strictly code-related discussion".
If you repeatedly ignore this, your comments might be deleted,
in which case there will be no reason stated.

If a PR takes too long to review, or gets forgotten,
try to tag a specific username in your comment of which
you were expecting review. Note that it can take a while to review changes,
depending on how much time people have. Repeatedly tagging people
or writing update requests without waiting for a response might
also get hidden or deleted, if it doesn't help moving the PR forward
and clutters the comment section.
